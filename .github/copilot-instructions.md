# AI Assistant Guidelines for Park Vaahan Project

## Documentation Management

### Refer to these files when user ask any question

- Location: `docs/` directory in project root
- Files:
  - `PRD.md`: Project Requirements Document
  - `scratchpad.md`: Working document for planning and progress tracking

### Scratchpad Usage Rules

1. Use `scratchpad.md` to:
   - Track reusable components (libraries, models, fixes)
   - Document lessons learned
   - Organize thought process
   - Plan task implementation steps
   - Track task progress
   - Record milestone reflections

2. For each new task:
   - Review existing scratchpad.md content
   - Clear unrelated previous task notes
   - Document task explanation
   - List implementation steps
   - Update progress as subtasks are completed

## Task Implementation Protocol

### Pre-Implementation

1. Review relevant documentation (PRD.md, scratchpad.md)
2. Update design decisions if needed

### During Implementation

2. Maintain task hierarchy
3. Complete all subtasks before marking main task complete
4. Implement features across all required platforms before progression

### Post-Implementation

1. Document any implementation deviations
2. Update relevant documentation
3. Add new configuration requirements
4. Record lessons learned in scratchpad.md
5. Mark task as complete

### Task Management

- Create new PRD.md entries for feature ideas
- Track implementation progress in scratchpad.md
- Document technical decisions and lessons learned
